# React 3D Point Cloud Editor

A simple 3D point cloud editor built with React, React Fiber, and the drei library. This project allows you to create, select, and manipulate cubes in a 3D scene using a user-friendly editor panel.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Features

- 3D Scene: The main scene displays a cube in the center that can be selected and manipulated.
- Cube Selection: Clicking on the cube opens an editor panel to modify its rotation, scale, and translation.
- Live Updates: Changes made in the editor panel are immediately reflected in the 3D scene.
